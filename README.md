# Macalester Rocket Avionics

This is the code for the avionics stack for the Macalester College High Power Rocketry team. It is currently in a very early state and in active development. At the moment, it just logs data, but active roll control with sensor fusion is in progress.

Hardware:
- Microcontroller: Adafruit Feather RP2040 Adalogger
- High-G accelerometer: ADXL375
- Gyroscope and low-G accelerometer: LSM6DSOX
- Magnetometer: LIS3MDL
- Barometer: BMP390
- GPS module: MTK3333 on an Adafruit Ultimate GPS Featherwing

At the moment, all sensors but the GPS are connected over IÂ²C using Stemma QT, and the GPS module is connected over UART. A custom FeatherWing PCB is in progress to combine all the sensors onto one board, improve interrupt support, add battery monitoring, and much more.

Supports a buzzer with built-in driver circuitry for state notification; PWM buzzers are not supported at the moment.
